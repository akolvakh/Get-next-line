# Get-next-line

The aim of this project is to make you code a function that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

This project helps to improve understanding of static variables in C programming, also gain a deeper understanding of allocations, whether they happen on the stack memory or in the heap memory, the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer, the unexpected complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.
